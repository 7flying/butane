Fedora CoreOS Config Transpiler

Still a work in progress.

Each config spec is composed of a base and distro component. The base components
roughly mirror the Ignition spec and are distro agnostic. The distro compoents
contain sugar for common configuration of the host (e.g. etcd) and are not
distro-independent.

Each distro and base component are versioned independently with each new
version getting it's own package. These versions are not exposed to the user.

Each fcos config version has it's own version which is independent of the
versions of the base and distro components that compose it. However a major
or minor bump of either component necesitates a corresponding bump in the fcos
config version.

internal/
  main, non-exported code

base/
  Contains distro-agnostic code. Each package here targets only one Ignition
  spec verions.

distro/
  Contains distro-specific code. Each package here can target multiple Ignition
  versions if it makes sense.

config/
  Contains definitions combining an entry in base and an entry in distro. Also
  contains the top level Translate() function that determines which version to
  parse and emit.
